Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to VT Fitness gym members and potential members. The website highlights their core values, membership package, their equipments and facilities and also their classes.
Besides I have made a short video to show my gym room.

UX:<br>
=======
My goal is to promote the newly open gym room named VT Fitness and to attract new gym members. Besides, it will provide more information about my gym room.


Features:<br>
=======
This site used the icon from font awesome, google font, icon8 etc.The navbar stays collapsed in all screen size to promote a minimalist design.

Technologies used:<br>
=======
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (3.3.7)

Testing:<br>
=======
This site was tested on different screen size (iphone XR, ipad, Samsung phone) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 
Besides, I have tested the site across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox).

For the form, I have added the 'required' attribute to the 'name' and 'phone number' hence if these two are not filled in, the form will not submit.
The email will be optional as we will mainly contact them through phone or whatsapp. 
However I will still encourage the potential customer to fill in their email to receive our monthly newsletter.

Deployment:<br>
=======
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
